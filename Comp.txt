A computer system implements 8 kilobyte pages and a +32-bit physical address space. Each page table entry contains a valid bit, a dirty bit, three permission bits, and the translation. If the maximum size of the page table of a process is 24 megabytes, the length of the virtual address supported by the system is _________ bits.
(A) 36
(B) 32
(C) 28
(D) 40
Explanation: A page table entry has following number of bits.
1 (valid bit) + 
1 (dirty bit) + 
3 (permission bits) + 
x bits to store physical address space of a page.

Value of x = (Total bits in physical address) - 
             (Total bits for addressing within a page)
Since size of a page is 8 kilobytes, total bits needed within
a page is 13.
So value of x = 32 - 13 = 19

Putting value of x, we get size of a page table entry =
                                   1 + 1 + 3  + 19 = 24bits.

Number of page table entries 
           = (Page Table Size) / (An entry size)
           =  (24 megabytes / 24 bits)                             
           =  223

Vrtual address Size 
             = (Number of page table entries) * (Page Size)
             =  223 * 8 kilobits
             = 236  
Therefore, length of virtual address space = 36

1.	mutual exclusion
The resources involved must be unshareable; otherwise, the processes would not be prevented from using the resource when necessary.
2.	hold and wait or partial allocation
The processes must hold the resources they have already been allocated while waiting for other (requested) resources. If the process had to release its resources when a new resource or resources were requested, deadlock could not occur because the process would not prevent others from using resources that it controlled.
3.	no pre-emption
The processes must not have resources taken away while that resource is being used. Otherwise, deadlock could not occur since the operating system could simply take enough resources from running processes to enable any process to finish.
4.	resource waiting or circular wait

If Human voice is required to be digitized what will be the bit rate at 16 bits per sample? 

Therefore, the bit rate can be calculated by calculating the sample rate first.
Sampling rate = 4000 x 2 = 8000 samples/s
Considering the bit rate to be 16 bits per sample,

A half adder is implemented with XOR and AND gates. A full adder is implemented with two half adders and one OR gate. The propagation delay of an XOR gate is twice that of an AND/OR gate. The propagation delay of an AND/OR gate is 1.2 microseconds. A 4-bit ripple-carry binary adder is implemented by using four full adders. The total propagation time 
of this 4-bit binary adder in microseconds is ____________.
A Ripple Carry Adder allows to add two n-bit numbers. It uses half and full adders. Following diagram shows a ripple adder using full adders.
 
Let us first calculate propagation delay of a single
1 bit full adder.

Propagation Delay by n bit full adder is (2n + 2) 
gate delays.
[See this for formula].

Here n = 1, so total delay of a 1 bit full adder 
is (2 + 2)*1.2 = 4.8 ms

Delay of 4 full adders is = 4 * 4.8 = 19.2 ms

Assume that a table CUSTOMER has 10000 records. If the block size 1024 bytes and the record size is 80 bytes, how many records can be stored in each block to achieve maximum performance and how many blocks are required to store the entire table?
Number of records in file = 16384

Record size = 32 bytes
Key Size = 6 bytes
Block Size on file system = 1024 bytes
Size of Block Pointer = 10 bytes

Size of a record or index Entry = 10 + 6 = 16 

Number of blocks in first level = (Number of records in file)/
                                   (Disk Block Size)
                                = (16384 * 16)/(1024)
                                = 16 * 16
                                = 256

In second level, there will be 256 * 16 entries.
Number of blocks in second level = (Number of entries) / 
                                   (Block Size)
                                 = (256 * 16) / 1024
                                 = 4

How many address bits are needed to select all memory locations in the 16K × 1 RAM?
The size of the memory is N*M

where N is the address lines and M is word length
no of registers/memory location required is 2^N

Given memory capacity is 16k 
thus 2^N=16K
1K=1024 memory locations
thus16k=16*1024=16384
now 2^N=16384
After factorising 16384 by 2 we ll get N AS 14
SO ADDRESS LINE REGUIRED IS 14.

In stop and wait ARQ, the sequence numbers are generated using
Maximum sequence number in GBN is same as window size.
For sequence bits = n, number of sequence numbers = 2n and window size = 2n - 1
Consider n = 3, sequence numbers will be 23 = 8 ( i.e. from 0 - 7 )
and maximum window size = 23 - 1 = 7 i.e  window will carry frames  from 0 to 6 which are 7 in number.
Now, for sender window = 5
number of sequence bits needed = ceil (log2(1+window size)) = 3
So, sequence numbers generated would be 0 to 7 but window will carry frames from 0 to 4 which is 5 in number (same as window size)

A 4-way set-associative cache memory unit with a capacity of 16 KB is built using a block size of 8 words. The word length is 32 bits. The size of the physical address space is 4 GB. The number of bits for the TAG field is
Number of sets = cache size / sizeof a set 

Size of a set = blocksize * no. of blocks in a set  
= 8 words * 4 (4-way set-associative) 
= 8*4*4 (since a word is 32 bits = 4 bytes) 
= 128 bytes. 

So, number of sets = 16 KB / (128 B) = 128
Now, we can divide the physical address space equally between these 128 sets. So, the number of bytes each set can access 
= 4 GB / 128 
= 32 MB 
= 32/4 = 8 M words = 1 M blocks. (220 blocks) 

So, we need 20 tag bits to identify these 220 blocks.

DMA is useful for the operations
DMA is useful for transferring data between memory and devices if large volume of data is to be transferred, or the devices have small response times. Because after setting up buffers, pointers, and counters for the I/O device, the device controller transfers an entire block of data directly to or from its own buffer storage to memory, with no intervention by the CPU. Only one interrupt is generated per block, rather than the one interrupt per byte (or word) generated for low-speed devices.
Alternatively, you may simply say:
DMA is useful for transferring large quantities of data between memory and devices. It eliminates the need for the CPU to be involved in the transfer, allowing the transfer to complete more quickly and the CPU to perform other tasks concurrently.

This layout is useful when read performance or reliability is more important than write performance or the resulting data storage capacity.

The size of the data count register of a DMA controller is 16 bits. The processor needs to transfer a file of 29,154 kilobytes from disk to main memory. The memory is byte addressable. The minimum number of times the DMA controller needs to get the control of the system bus from the processor to transfer the file from the disk to main memory is

Ans 
Size of data count register of the DMA controller = 16 bits
Data that can be transferred in one go = 216 bytes = 64 kilobytes
File size to be transferred = 29154 kilobytes
So, number of times the DMA controller needs to get the control of the system bus from the processor to transfer the file from the disk to main memory = ceil(29154/64) = 456

The processes must hold the resources they have already been allocated while waiting for other (requested) resources.

7.	no pre-emption
The processes must not have resources taken away while that resource is being used. Otherwise, deadlock could not occur since the operating system could simply take enough resources from running processes to enable any process to finish.
8.	resource waiting or circular wait
