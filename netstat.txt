This tutorial explains Linux “netstat” command, options and its usage with examples.

netstat – Print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships

DESCRIPTION

netstat (network statistics) is a command line tool for monitoring network connections both incoming and outgoing as well as viewing routing tables, interface statistics etc. netstat is available on all Unix-like Operating Systems and also available on Windows OS as well. It is very useful in terms of network troubleshooting and performance measurement. netstat is one of the most basic network service debugging tools, telling you what ports are open and whether any programs are listening on ports.

SYNOPSIS

netstat [-a] [-n] [-v]

netstat [-g | -m | -p | -s | -f address_family ] [-n] [-P protocol]

netstat [ -i ] [ -I interface ] [ interval ]

netstat -r [-a] [-n] [-v ]

netstat -M [-n] [-s ]

netstat -D [ -I interface ]

OPTIONS :

-a
Show the state of all sockets and all routing table entries; normally, sockets used by server processes are not shown and only interface, host, network, and default routes are shown.
-n
Show network addresses as numbers. netstat normally displays addresses as symbols. This option may be used with any of the display formats.
-v
Verbose. Show additional information for the sockets and the routing table.
-g
Show the multicast group memberships for all interfaces.
-m
Show the STREAMS statistics.
-p
Show the address resolution (ARP) tables.
-s
Show per-protocol statistics. When used with the -M option, show multicast routing statistics instead.
-i
Show the state of the interfaces that are used for TCP/IP traffic.
-r
Show the routing tables.
-M
Show the multicast routing tables. When used with the -s option, show multicast routing statistics instead.
-d
Show the state of all interfaces that are under Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) control.
-D
Show the status of DHCP configured interfaces.
-f address_family
imit statistics or address control block reports to those of the specified address_family, which can be one of:
inet For the AF_INET address family
unix For the AF_Unix address family

-P protocol
Limit display of statistics or state of all sockets to those applicable to protocol.
– I interface
Show the state of a particular interface. interface can be any valid interface such as ie0 or
le0.

EXAMPLES

1. Listing Various Listening Ports

Listing all the LISTENING Ports of TCP and UDP connections

# netstat -a | more

Listing TCP Ports connections

# netstat -at
 

Listing UDP Ports connections

# netstat -au

2. Listing various Listening connections

Listing all LISTENING Connections

# netstat -l
 
Listing all TCP Listening Ports

Listing all active listening TCP ports by using option netstat -lt.

# netstat -lt
 

Listing all UDP Listening Ports

Listing all active listening UDP ports by using option netstat -lu.

# netstat -lu
 

3. Showing Statistics by Different Protocols

Showing statistics of all protocols

# netstat -s
 
Showing Statistics by TCP Protocol

# netstat -st
Showing Statistics by UDP Protocol

# netstat -su
 
Udp:
    1774823 packets received
    901848 packets to unknown port received.
    0 packet receive errors
    2968722 packets sent

4. Displaying Service name with PID

# netstat -tp

tcp        1      0 192.168.0.2:59292           www.gov.com:http            CLOSE_WAIT  1939/clock-applet

5. Display Kernel IP routing table

# netstat -r
 
Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags   MSS Window  irtt Iface
192.168.0.0     *               255.255.255.0   U         0 0          0 eth0
link-local      *               255.255.0.0     U         0 0          0 eth0
default         192.168.0.1     0.0.0.0         UG        0 0          0 eth0

6. Showing network interface packet transactions
